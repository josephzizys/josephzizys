        <h3>Welcome to my page about Buddhism, very broadly conceived indeed.</h3>

        <p>Therevada is for killing. Mahayana is for drugs. Vajravada is for fucking. Buddhism is about fucking, killing and being out of your mind.</p>

        <p> The Buddha taught that there where two cognitive biases that tended to distort human thought; the tendency towards realism, and the tendency towards nominalism. The Buddha taught that there was a middle ground between these alternatives, characterised by recourse to phrases like "when this, then that" and "where we find this, that comes to be, where this ceases, that ceases also". It has been argued that this concept is best related n English to that of "causality", but this term is so loaded down with essentialist baggage that it seems ill suited to the task, it is therefore more useful to analyse the Buddha's position in terms of dependance, a more neutral term. his characterised dependance can be shown to underly and inform many of the central rubrics of mainstream buddhism, the 12 links, the 5 heaps, the 8 fold path and the four truths are all concrete instantiations of the dependence principal. By positing a philosophy that charts an alternative to the realism of Plato and nominalist alternatives, the Buddha is therefore a philosopher of first rank, and it is clear that there is a deep and sophisticated philosophy, sensitive to the traps both of absolutism and relativism, that is prior even to the sutra strata of early buddhist texts. Dependence as a positive principle also casts shadows implying both "not self" (taken as the concept that there are no groundless independent substances) and "suffering" (taken as the idea that there is never a completed or stable arrangement, states of affairs are always dependent on others). Emptiness is thus simply the Mahayana restatement of "not-self" applied to a less personal, psychological, more public, physical worldview, that is that "things" do not have substantive, essential self-existence. </p>
