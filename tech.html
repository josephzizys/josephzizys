        <h3>Welcome to my page about technology, programming and technical literacy</h3>

        <p>Not much here right now. I dream. I fantisise. I waste time. I get distrated. Things interest me. I find this then that then some other thing interesting. I spend time with the things that interest me. I dream with the thing that interest me. I love you. </p>

        <p>In addition to Sublime Text I use Vim for editing little files that need a quick edit that can be done from the terminal. with git, bash, vim and homebrew in your programming arsenel you can really kick ass. </p>

        <p> In a while I will put up cheat sheets for the linux bash command line, for git, for html, for css and perhpas for javascript. That way people visiting this site will not only be able to read the english I am writing, but if they like, they can download the html etc and read and understand that. I want to blur the line between the technical part of language and the literary. The so called two cultures. I want to write interesting prose but I want to maintain html and css and javascript and use the command line and push commits to git and the whole thing. The seperation of these two worlds spoils much I think. I think therefore I am. I am right. I am. Think about it.</p>
