        <h3>Welcome to my poetry and writing page</h3>

        <p>Not much here right now. I wanted a second page to link to from the homepage, so here it is. We will see. I love making love. I love women. I love sex. I love the taste of pussy. I love wet pussy. I think I love you. I think I love. I think. I love. I. Will you come and visit me? Will you come? Come. Come on me. Please come. Come. </p>

        <p>
          there is a music
that pierces the vale
between the worlds
a keening noise
a sound that transforms
that reminds us that there is a truth in solipsism
that makes us alone
that recalls that we die
there is a singer
who is a slave to the song
and a song that is a door
an invocation
to the spirits in the room
a crack
between the worlds
and the yawning
un space
of the between 
between

***

sleeping and waiting
and fucking and speaking
and waking up
and eating
and shitting
and talking
and seeking

***

bed
bed till your led
in the morning
to tables then fed
all the boring details
of your day
then home again hey
back to bed
again and again
till your dead

you probably shouldn't
have wed

***

Make me an offer
money for work
conversation then fucking
have you been single long
are you unemployed
why did you leave your last lover
why did you leave your last job
where do you see yourself
in five years time
with you 
with you
I'll run the company
We'll run away
together

Is it time for a new start?

***

City of rape
City of rape
when the preachers of hate
with a nod and a wink
open the gates
let people think
its all just a game
we should take what we need
city of rape 
city of rape
turn back the boats
on the tides of hate
when the law speakers speak
then they call down the fates
in the city of rape
city of rape
when the blank faces in suits
point the finger at you
and we all just sit down
like we've nothing to do
then the scum in their holes
smell the changing of worlds
in the city of rape
in the city of rape
with the suspension of rule
for the chosen and few
then we all seem to know
what new thing we can do
in the city of rape
in the city of rape
stand up
stand up
stand up and be not bowed down
or the cancer will come
the cancer will come
and your city will burn 
your city will burn

i'm no good
at going out
i'm no good
at writing poetry
i got no skills - 
girls like wild deer
glance at me
as they walk quickly by
too cold
this spring night
what the fuck
am i doing out here
"to be warm for hours"
says the singer
in my machine
music
another thing i am no good at
fuck

***

say things
out loud
true things
that no one else will say
because you want to save people
from thinking they are alone
and you want not to be alone
and so you speak

**

what difference does it make
if you don't do anything
sit still
breath
the whole world is a lie
a trap for fools
the impulse to fame
is rank vanity
give it up

***

I have always been captivated
by hidden worlds

the magic lands
of childhood story

and later
the brothel door

secret things that belie the world of the known
that make in us a mystery

the glance that promises
like the magic land or

the red, tacky door that no one wants to be seen going through
or coming out

***

Mention death
and a color
red perhaps
or mention a green bird
and trivial things
that might provoke
an unfortunate association
a child with a wooden toy
an animal perhaps
a green wooden bird
in the hands of the child
a river that is running away
like the year that are running away
just keep talking
until a turn of phrase
finds you
or not..

I thought I might
write poetry
but then delete the returns that made a new line
and so I would have prose
I suspect I suck at poetry
perhaps it is good prose.
or not..

***

empty is the river
it is a river of air
flowing
a cold wind run low along the ground
day and night

the pulse
pounds in the ear
what is in the heart
rushes up
reaches out
but in touching
bursts

like the bubble
touched by the terrible, invincible child
the anti-midas

empty are all our dreams
of fame
of understanding
nights of cold indifference
stars dim
drowning in the wash
of terrestrial lights

***

i dreamt of shark and koi and catfish
i dreamt of swimming pools and french emperors
i dreamt of spears and kings and a trail through the wilderness
all these dreams as real as anything i ever saw
and sunk with meanings more poignant and more troubling
than any news from abroad could be. 

***

no money
home to smoke pot
and talk
music

back in the city
all the pretty girls
with their conservative cloths
and plump legs

***

every body
makes waves
in the ocean of longing
that is my heart

so fucking tired
must put down -
the little projects keeping me sane
and rest

family has worn me out
to a coffee fueled mess
unable even
to sleep

***

mixing lyric
with poesy
makes toil
for the editor
and they're all me
boo

***

all the young girls
so pitilessly conservative
waiting for the right man
i am
the wrong man baby
i am the wrong man
. 

pit
pit
pit of the stomach
the pitiless stomach
telling you
what you do not want to know
.

smokes
mark the time and place
each significance
marked with a little communion
with cancerous death
.

warm tonight
I sweat into my unfashionable cloths
the curve of her spine
catches my eye
the beer churning in my stomach
.

waiting for an old friend
come to chase the same old dream
of night in the city
where the women are
where the pulse is
.

snatches of conversation jostle
in the evening air
running through my phenom
competing
with the sick sick sick
.

later
when the rush comes
this will be long forgotten
returning only
when the head finally hits the pillow

***

smoke calls:
death
death
death
.

no more hiding
this reminder -
on the lips
cutting into the lung-

the tart rank smell
impregnates the skin
promise
promise of pain to come -

the pain that does not relent
the pain of death
death
death
.

the beautiful singer
and her beautiful song
are what will be taken
death -

what we must give up,
the taking of which,
is the pain that compounds -
death death death
.

smoke.
a reminder.
death
death
death

***

oh oh wait
don't touch there
it tickles
then leaves me cold
do something else
something better
i don't know what
something erotic
something else
erotic
listen to the music
it will tell you what to do
maybe
or not
i don't know
lets just go to sleep
forever

***

much technical groundwork
much maintenance
everything takes time
each moment spent
is a choice made

the creation of art
does not excuse us from decency
if the children need company
lay down the pen
the pen can wait

meter is as inessential to poetry
as rhyme
seeking, and then speaking truth
is the essence
what else is language for?

just practice writing down
those thoughts that truly occur to you
as much as you are able
while still being dutiful
everything else is corruption
.

***

black oil from the ground
ancient crushed death
brought back to burn
makes our world go round

merchants of death
these americans
patrolling the fields with their guns
the oil fields far away

they cover their whores in oil 
oil over silicon breasts
sent over silicon chips
to a billion fat masturbaters

oil and sand
taken from the poor at gunpoint
from the "terrorists"
that is all America has

weapons of death
big cars for fat people
impossible pornography
Americas empire

***

the last day of the year -
the new moon arrives in the evening
many loose ends tied up

but the twine is like a weed -
it grows in the heart
creating new entanglements

the car is at the wreckers
the plates are returned
the check is in the mail -
here comes the year

***

summer is here
the clear air makes colors sharp
even in the morning
the sun is hot

the middle part of the day
will chase us into shade
or air conditioned rooms
but for now...

thoughts come and go
my children keep each other company
and ensure I'm not alone

at home my wife studies
we must take turns -
small birds take what the chickens do not bother with -

today I am of a mind
to have adult conversation
hopeful, I look forward
to chance meetings ...

all the rain
has made the world green -
even now in the late summer
the flowers are still in bloom

my new straw hat -
where was I?
kishi bishi plays on repeat in my head
my well shaded head

summer and childs play
scatter thoughts on the breeze
did I mention
there is a breeze?

***

too many weeks
with too little sleep
coughing from the chest
.
the crying child
demands too much
of an exhausted mother
.
little things don't work
catastrophes far away
alter our delicate balancing act-
.
deprive us
of our small supports
and we fall down
.
the eldest, just four and a half
sensing something he cannot comprehend
becomes hysterical
.
it is a hot day
and we have obligations
we have to go
.
then my 2 year old
tries to stick his dick
into a large lego block
.
lolz

***

mathematical induction
is simply the law
that whatever the number
theres always one more
so n might be anything
anything at all

so with the primes
and euclids proof
imagine that five
is the primes upper roof
now ask yourself, well ...
if 2
by 3
by 5 is thirty
and i add one to this sum
to get 31
then this 31 aught
be able to sort
into piles of equal size
unless its a prime...

now 5 is n
and so is n+ a 1
and so on forever
never all done

the ballad of moondog and harry partch:

"this thing BEGAN with truth"
said harry partch
"and truth DOES exist"

horny as fuck
it ebbs and flows
some days a tidal wave
some days
nothing but sand for miles
nice days those
just walking on the beach
not drowning in fuck
these are the currents that rule our lives
some float on lust
some in anger and fear
some in daydreams and fantasy
only the dimmest apprehension
of these tides and currents is possible
we see the roiling swell
the crashing wave
but not the depths
so some days
I'm drowning
horny as fuck

***

fictions
stitching together only the very best lies
we make our reality

***

the repetition of silence
of what cannot be said
into a cacophony
.
sometimes only great quiet
is sufficient
to hear a silenced voice
.
the silenced voice
speaks only into great silence
not great noise
.

***

if this, then that
when this, then that
where this, there that
it depends
it depends
dependent on the mothers breast
the baby suckles
dependent on the soil and the rain
the harvest grows
dependent on food, we do not starve
this was the first teaching of the buddha
not four truths
or five heaps
or eight steps
or twelve links
but that things depend on other things
so there is no ground

***

no words
really mean what they mean
to one who has given up
the illusion
of real worlds

***

no words
can escape reification
if the mind that apprehends them
has not escaped
the misplaced faith
in 'existence'

***

when you ask for the teaching
of the buddha
you are not asking for a creed -
some kind of 'belief'
like the christian
with their personal savior
you are asking for
an actual map to heaven
would you denigrate a god-fearing man
for not being able to give you that?

***

so when you ask a buddhist
what the buddha taught
if they strike you
as overconfident
perhaps take them
with a grain of salt

***

there may be a 'beginning'
what they called
the opening of the eye of wisdom
but
that was just the first step
the real eureka moment
was nirvana

***

firstly,
on one reading of the material
it is not possible
to know what the buddha taught
at least
not completely
without being
enlightened yourself

***

the habit of writing
once it becomes a habit
seeks out its own motivations
now vanity, now earnestness
now smart-assery
it is the writing that makes use
of the motive
not the other way around

***

the weight of my child's round head
resting on my arm
anchors me to the room

***

she said she was 12 years younger
holy fuck
she said lets go out again
i said
yes

***

that night
my father lay in hospital
i drew a card that said death
later a luminous green skull
pulsed with light
my friend
not yet in remission of his own cancer
was there
and in defiance
or acceptance
of all the symbolism floating round
i smoked cigarettes
and neither laughed nor cried
at death

***

this morning
i am deaf
the television prattles
while the child eats his breakfast
coffee in hand
I watch him
jaded
he is a musical child
but seriously
fuck the Wiggles

***

long anticipation
gleefully fulfilled
something even more
than what was wished for
communion

***

coming home from the revival
with the hooker of my dreams
through the dangerous neighborhood
the cab takes us north
till various arithmetics
leave me alone
to continue my journey through the night. 


***

the card said: death. 
I never go out drinking for anything less,
I said to myself. 
perhaps tonight
it is especially true. 

a sensitive soul
should not read the cards. 

do not trust the woman
the card said. 
i never do
said I,
but i am afraid
of death
and want warm arms
to wrap me in forgetting. 

***

who dies?
death is spread out. 
when it takes one
it takes a further piece of each
making space, the card said
space for what?

***

death and forgetting
empty spaces
each thing needs its particular space,
its envelope.

to and fro
again and again
alternating

the full belly
the vacant bones

***

the welling up
of great joy
requires a deep space
so sad
that joy is thus bound
to all this death -
nevertheless

***

when death is present
we are gone
when we are here
death is not present -

but death comes
and the waves and tumult
that roil before him
debase us
bring us low

perhaps he will but pass by
and our boat will right
for another while

but perhaps the waves
portent us more
or less

we can not know

not the hour
not the final cause
not with certainty

but we know it comes
it comes to us all
death comes

***

tomorrow
and again and again

***

auto caps turned off
no more autocorrect
chinese keyboards
wonderful ephemera
playing on my phone

***

another slow day
hiding in the cool indoors
from the hot sun outside
plans are made and undone
perhaps tomorrow
perhaps not
perhaps
another slow day
what is so wrong
with slow days
in summer
hiding in the cool indoors

***

sleep
dreams
death
forgetting
and forgetting
again

***

a wandering eye
an unguarded look
leads on
to entanglement
after entanglement
better to stare at ones feet
than be led around by ones dick
still -
what is a party for?

***

strange friends
an eclectic collection
meet to drink
and play
a quiet, polite, evening
for this secular
festival

***

two crows
a third
they walk
cautiously across the road
seeking food
and diversion -
beautiful women
occasionally walk by
and I crane my neck
to see

***

so closes
my 36th year on this earth
in glorious sunshine.
while invisible
the torments of age
and youth
lurk at the periphery.
the city prepares
for the thronging mass
come to mark the turning -
there is a hangnail
on my toe

***

the playground
children play
very serious
the sun that gives us life
slowly burns us
we all must leave the playground
don't cry
it is time

***

the myth of progress
distrust of all tradition
naive acceptance of authority
dismissal of other views
what makes the modern
so distasteful?

***

drunken confessions
made vague by incoherence
telling nonetheless
of regrets
of longings unfulfilled

staggeringly impractical solutions are suggested
wistfully appraised by watery eyes
staring into the middle distance
then waved away in disgust

honesty devolves towards
mumbling repetition
it's time for bed
but we don't want to go
I pull the pin
tomorrow it will be me
up early

***

a writer
speaking to blank faces
recalls that profound recognition
of kinship
in reading some author long dead
so it is
that he writes, not desiring immortality, 
but understanding

***

Christmas morning
The cat, the youngest and I
Watch playschool
While my eldest and my wife
Sleep in
After last nights
Festivities

***

That is to say
That we wish to be understood
And to be liked
Not to feel liked
Or feel understood
The feeling matters not at all
Or very little
So my father
Painstakingly keeps his writings
Against his encroaching death
Not because he seeks immortality
Or hopes to enjoy fame
In some afterworld
But because he seeks to be known
Dead or alive. 

***

Just as if
Suspecting we where slandered
Behind our back
We would not wish
To die before learning the truth
But rather
That it be not so
Likewise
Writing down our thought
We hope to be understood
Even if we ourselves
Must be dust
When it happens

***

The children
Determine the disorder of my house
My wife abed
We stayed up late
Drinking
And fucking

***

Death does not become him
Flailing wildly
He staggers toward oblivion
Look at me!
Look at me!
Everything that worked for him
In life
Now conspires
To make a mockery

***

Reading Du Fu
On friendship
I recall the grey
At Alex's temples
And feel a thousand years and more
Cannot diminish truth
So well spoken

***

Recollecting
The sex of the previous night
Wet pussy in my mouth,
Grinding
Then,
Picking hairs from my teeth

Up early,
Child's diarrhea,
Now a rattling cough.
Playschool and cold pasta,
I await reinforcements.

***

the crickets chirp
my wife snorts off my advances
like a startled horse
a drunken, startled horse.
not that I've ever fucked a horse.

***

Late, late into the night.
In our shared office
the kids asleep in the next room.
drinking
the whirr of computer fans.
burgers and beers
our only respite
the night

***

fucking poetry man.
One line at a time.
one word after another.
on and on.

***

poetry.
the written word constrained.
no stream of consciousness here.
just thought. thought. thought.
one by one.

***

How could it be
that I do not do this always?
So easily it goes.
So much straining avoided.

***

Poor Mamma-Bear.
Stuck in the hot, small bed.
With two already rested children.
Too late to still be up.
To much invested to give up.

the creaking through the walls.
occasion repeated surges of my heart.
will she? won't she?
egg shells, fucking egg shells man
one 2, the other 4.

By the time she escapes
too little, too late
and no promise of a deserved rest.
God.

***
