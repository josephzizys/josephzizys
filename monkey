they came for him at night.
when he could only be alone.
when he touched himself.
he knew they where there when they touched him.
so many hands joining his own.
touching his junk.
his funky, funky junk.
till he came.
his warm hot milk issuing forth in spurts.
like a litttle miricle.
him and the monkeys.
the pert, hot monkeys.
that visited him.
in the night.
he would never forget them.
never.
so go fuck yourself.
