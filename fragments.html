        <h3>Welcome to my page of writing fragments</h3>

        <p>Not much here right now. But there will be. There wil ne. Bwah ha ha hah hah ... heh. </p>

        …in the 1960's is was the middle aged who created the structure for revolution. The hippies, the young, did not create out of whole cloth, it was these middle aged, disillusioned adults, who finding the suits and the suaveness empty had collapsed, desperate for reinvention, afraid of virginia woolf but wanting something more nonetheless. the young, seeing their parents rebel against the confines of marriage and career and even style, are free to perform their own utopia, "here, they say to Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant, here is the life that you are dreaming when you are rejecting what you have…. 

        <p>…cycling down the street he saw a baby, to call it a child would be too much, not more than one year old, but walking, filthy, in a nappy and a singlet, along the fence towards the corner. It appeared to have come from the driveway, so, cooing and murmuring, he herded the infant back towards the yard, all the while remaining on his bike, on the road. the little one was amenable, and once in it's yard it became apparent that another, this one perhaps two years, was there as well, "hello, where is your mum?" "my dad is in the shed" "HELLO" then out of the shed come two young men, and the larger of the two, hearing the tale, says "NOT AGAIN" and whisks the kids inside. Pleasantries and anecdotes are exchanged with the skinnier, remaining man, then the journey continues….</p>

        <p>… what to write, what even to think, what to do when you know so little, dare to know so little, when everything around you shows the cracks, the precariousness, teetering on the edge, to walk on eggshells, or to push, or to just not know what to do, what to say, another change coming, another wind, change wether we want it or no, work coming, long journeys, often it seems that in the past these junctures are marked by a testing of the boundary, only relenting, without acknowledgment, when the danger is past, but each time there is a chance, a chance that something does break, will break, has broken, what to say, when you have not been given permission to know, when knowing is an invasion of privacy, an attack on autonomy, but to remain supine, to sit with ignorance, that is to be attacked as well, there is nothing to say until inspiration or calamity intervenes, for anything said from some base mood or moment is bound to reveal just one of the tumult of emotions, reasons, thoughts and possibilities, why crystallise some imperfect word and world when you might wait for the muse to guide you to your fate, so i suppose i live in hope, that whatever breaks will crack and shatter like an egg or a chrysalis, revealing something more alive, more real, something that flourishes and grows, rather than the break of the terrorist attack, the dirty bomb, leaving the debry, the carnage in its wake and the shattered lives, better to wait for that inspiration better to make love not war, to dream of a bright day than to fear a darkening world…. good luck.</p>

        <p>…"I wanna leave you so bad." she says under her breath as they sit down at the restaurant table, kids grabbing menus and wriggling into chairs. The sentence barely finished as her father appears from parking the car, "is everything good? you all look very serious." Unable to compose himself the no longer young man heads to the toilet, but he wishes he had the courage, and the cruelty, to just leave...</p>

        <p>…sharp though. soft milky skin. observant. elegant fingers. principled. kind to strangers. shy. committed. eyes that change color from gray to blue to green. a hidden, subterranean sexuality. volcanic and deep. sensitive. long wild hair and an elegant neck. like a deer or a woman from some other century. knowledgable. dogged. strong...<p>

        <p>…over the rolling grassy hills outside geelong eagles hunt for rabbits. the eagle is like a keening hunger that hangs from the sky. its sight is motivated. a whole continua of perception twisted around that need in the form of a being. the eagle is as much made by the rabbit as anything in the world. the rabbit,s need for unbeing distorts the sky above it into a clump of talons and feathers...</p>

        <p>…moods. modes. modalities. spaces. ambience. situation. situatedness. degrees of freedom. manifold. metric.  relationship. relative. father. mother. money. maybe. rich. poor. premature. vasectomy. consultation. cultivation. mythology. sacred. story. sample. space. exhaustion. entropy. unraveling. rhizome. death. dying. letting. go. bloodletting...</p>
